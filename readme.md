# TCP Servers

This is a collection of TCP servers doing specific tasks

The goal of this project is to build small services that would make up a backend application using nothing but raw Javascript and nodejs. \

Maybe do some k8s or some shit

**Features**
1. No packages
2. Low level modules
- for example not using the http module to make an http server

AS RAW DOG I CAN GET WITH JAVASCRIPT
